Some general guidelines to keep things consistent:

- The header order::

    ========
    Header 1
    ========

    Header 2
    ========

    Header 3
    --------

    Header 4

- Use gender-neutral pronouns, if you have to at all.
- Put each sentence on a different line, if you can - this makes diffs much easier to read. You won't be able to in, for example, lists, but that's fine.
