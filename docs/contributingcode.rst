Contributing Code to Klein
==========================

Here's some suggestions to get a patch into Klein:

- Propose all patches through a pull request in the `GitHub repo <https://github.com/twisted/klein>`_.
- Make sure your patch has tests, since untested code is buggy code.
- If it's a new feature, add an example under ``docs/examples/`` and add it to the index.
- Put ``[WIP]`` in the title if it's a work in progress pull request.
